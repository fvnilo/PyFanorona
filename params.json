{"body":"### Welcome to PyFanorona\r\n\r\n![Fanorona board](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Fanorona-1.svg/800px-Fanorona-1.svg.png)\r\n\r\nThis project is a simple implementation of the Fanorona board game in Python. The rules of the game are simple:\r\n\r\n* The game is played on a 9x5 board;\r\n* White starts;\r\n* Each player alternate turns;\r\n* Possible moves are limited and defined by the lines on a board;\r\n* To win, you have to capture all of your opponent's pieces;\r\n* There are two kinds of capturing move: approaching one of your piece **to** an adjacent space of an enemy piece or withdrawing your piece away **from** an adjacent space;\r\n* Every enemy piece that was in the line of action is captured until the line is interrupted (a blank space of own piece);\r\n* Capturing moves are obligatory if any is possible;\r\n* Just like checkers, combos are allowed until no capture is possible\r\n\r\n### What you need\r\n\r\n* Python 2.7\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nVery minimalistic text-based interface. Need to eventually have a GUI. Combos are also not implemented yet.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@nylogavins","name":"PyFanorona","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
